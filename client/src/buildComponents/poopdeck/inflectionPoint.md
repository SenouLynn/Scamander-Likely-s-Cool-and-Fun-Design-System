# Critical Juncture

## Great Success

The system works. Poopdeck is the medium and through it, I shall codify the translation between browser and code. I can now CRUD with local state. 

Next Moves (in no particular order):

- I need to get the project off the ground stat. This means saving change somehow. The options are:
**- Literally write the file. This should be tried first
**- Hook up to dB. This is coal-burner level shit. Not now but will need soon.

- Start by building necessary classes, then building the component structure with the builder. Only use css to start to keep it simple.
**- Note how you build and prioritize which tools you use most
